- Wordle-style game with a twist. You have 6 guesses at a 5 letter word
	- Twist: starting the game also starts a 2.5 (?) minute timer
		- After the allotted time the word changes but you keep your progress with a number of letter randomly revealed that match your number of guesses

- Rough thoughts on models needed: 
	- Game
		- has one board
		- has one gameclock
	- Board
		- belongs to game
		- has many guesses
		- has many words
	- Guess
		- belongs to board
	- Word (Answer)
		- belongs to board
		- has many guesses?
	- GameClock
		- belongs to game

Flow: 
	- Game loads on page load, with a start button
	- When the player clicks start, they are presented with a standard wordle board and game keyboard
	- Timer is present somewhere on screen
		- Flashes at 1min/ 30sec / 10sec countdown
	- Player has 6 guesses to get the word in time
	- If the player doesn’t get the word in time, a new word is fetched
		- a random number of letters are revealed on the new word according to how many correct letters they have 
		- player keeps the same number of remaining guesses
		- rows are erased and the number of rows available is now equal to the number of guesses remaining
	- Keyboard should work like wordle’s, correct guesses are highlighted, correct guesses in the wrong spot are highlighted in a diff color, incorrect guesses are greyed out
